Those are somethings I can think of right now. It does take a good amount of time and practice 
to understand the different pieces. So don't expect to start today and finish it off by tomorrow. 
The key is to keep learning and keep doing it. Just make sure you love what you do and you'll 
be good in no time :).

Start by exploring basic web development concepts through YouTube tutorials. Channels like 
Sonny Sangha, Code With Antonio, and JavaScript Mastery offer beginner-friendly videos that 
introduce you to the world of web development. Spend some time each day watching these 
tutorials to get comfortable with the basics.
