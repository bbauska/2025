to understand the different pieces. So don't expect to start today and finish it off by tomorrow. 
The key is to keep learning and keep doing it. Just make sure you love what you do and you'll 
be good in no time :).

Start by exploring basic web development concepts through YouTube tutorials. Channels like 
Sonny Sangha, Code With Antonio, and JavaScript Mastery offer beginner-friendly videos that 
introduce you to the world of web development. Spend some time each day watching these 
tutorials to get comfortable with the basics.

<h2>Pride is the unwillingness to be wrong.</h2>
<h2>Humility is the opposite.</h2>

philanthropy is not real. It's giving back what should never have been taken in the first place. Greedy motherfucker's helping themselves sleep at night. But still giving them power. Usually by putting their fucking names on everything from Carnegie to Chase. These are pathetic human slobs who killed far more than they helped. Yes, killed.

Ferrarri's are faster<br>
Musk's fucking Tesla Motors is fascist
(a company he stole and did not create)

<p>Attack science and become an oligarch. You can NOT disprove science. It's fucking science. There is no MORE truth than that.</p>
<p>But if you do you are brainwashed. You're a MAGA idiot. I have no time for you. Ever again. Never. Fuck you and your LIES!</p>

Most Republican congressmen don't listen to their constituencies. Period.
